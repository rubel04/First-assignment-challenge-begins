            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a cornerstone technology used to control the look and feel of web pages, working alongside HTML and JavaScript. While HTML is responsible for the structure and content of the webpage, CSS focuses entirely on its presentation, defining how the elements should appear to users.

            CSS enables you to control the style and layout of HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, sizes, margins, and padding. This helps in transforming plain HTML documents into visually appealing web pages. You can apply styles to text, backgrounds, borders, and spacing to enhance the design of the page.
