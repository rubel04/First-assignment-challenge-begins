        MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like
        documents, rather than the traditional table-based relational database
        structure. This allows for more dynamic and scalable data models, making
        it well-suited for applications that handle large amounts of
        unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB is designed to support
        high availability, horizontal scaling, and large-scale data storage,
        making it popular for modern web applications. It allows developers to
        store data in a more natural, object-oriented way, aligning well with
        languages like JavaScript.
