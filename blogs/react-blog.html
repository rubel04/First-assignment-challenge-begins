            React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly in single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable components that manage their own state, making it easier to build dynamic, interactive web apps. React improves performance by using a virtual DOM, which efficiently updates only the parts of the user interface that need to change, rather than re-rendering the entire page. Known for its simplicity and flexibility, React is widely used to create fast and scalable web applications.
