            JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, versatile programming language used primarily to create dynamic and interactive content on websites. It enables real-time manipulation of web elements, allowing developers to modify HTML and CSS on the fly, handle events like clicks or form submissions, and update content without reloading the page. JavaScript runs directly in the browser, making websites more responsive and interactive. It also supports asynchronous programming, allowing developers to fetch data from servers in the background. With the ability to be used both on the client side and the server side (with Node.js), JavaScript has become essential for building modern, full-stack web applications.
