            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, typically on the server side. Built on Google Chrome's V8 engine, Node.js is designed to be fast and efficient, especially for building scalable, real-time applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it well-suited for handling multiple concurrent connections and tasks like APIs, web servers, and data-intensive applications. Node.js also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager), making it a powerful tool for server-side and full-stack JavaScript development.
